# Example App

*Get going with Eager!*

This is our example app. It shows the outline of how the average Eager app is made.
Whenever you want to build an app, just download this project and replace our code.

## Important notes

#### app.js

This is where the magic happens. Your app starts here.

#### app.css

This is where all the CSS for an app goes. Try to refrain from styling an app directly
in the JS whenever possible.

#### install.json

This is where all the <a href="https://eager.io/developer/docs/install-json">options
are added for the app</a>. <a href="http://install.json.is/">Syntax can be tricky</a>,
so be sure to double check it.

#### Additional notes

- <a href="https://eager.io/developer/docs/getting-started">Reading the docs</a>
tends to help more than you'd think.
- Make sure to prefix any classes and div's with `eager`, like shown in this app.
